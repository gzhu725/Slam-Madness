# Slam-Madness

Idea: each year, there are 4 tennis grand slams: the Australian Open, US Open, Wimbledon, and French Open. Given the round 1 assignments for each tournament, create a march madness diagram per tournament based on winning probabilities and update it annually. Below is an example of what a march madness bracket would look like, and this would translate over per tennis tournament. This app would be really good for people who bet on sports tournament results.
